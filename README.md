# AutoMLM

AutoMLM serves as an extension to regular XModelerML and is being developed as part of my PhD Thesis under supervision of Prof. Ulrich Frank at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potentials of different automation techniques to support the automatic construction of multi-level models. Multi-level modeling (MLM) is a novel conceptual modeling paradigm where users can specify arbitrary classication levels and defer instantiation of class properties, among others. AutoMLM serves as a experimentation environment only.
