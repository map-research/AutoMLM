# MLM Case Navigator

The MLM Case Navigator tool is being developed as part of my PhD Thesis under supervision of Prof. Ulrich Frank from the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potentials of different automation techniques to support the automatic construction of multi-level models.

Multi-level modeling (MLM) is a novel conceptual modeling paradigm where users can specify arbitrary classication levels and defer instantiation of class properties, among others.
My research considers four promising automation techniques that are tested against a number of so-called "cases."
A case represents a category of model snippets that highlight a particular promotion task.
Each case faces different challenges that should be adressed by the respective automation technique.

The following automation techniques will be considered:
- Formal Concept Analysis
- Lexical Databases
- Clustering Algorithms
- Classification Algorithms
- Large Language Models
