# AutoMLM

AutoMLM serves as an extension to regular XModelerML and is being developed as part of my PhD Thesis under supervision of Prof. Ulrich Frank at the University of Duisburg-Essen. 
The aim of the thesis is to investigate the potentials of different automation techniques to support the automatic construction of multi-level models. AutoMLM serves as a prototypical environment, where we implement and experiment with different automation approaches.

Multi-level modeling (MLM) is a novel conceptual modeling paradigm where users can specify arbitrary classication levels and defer instantiation of class properties, among others.
My research considers two automation approaches that are tested against a number of so-called "cases."
A case represents a category of model snippets that highlight a particular promotion task.
Each case faces different challenges that should be addressed by the respective automation technique.

The approaches to automation can be distinguished based on their underlying semantic school. 
Approach 1: Denotational sematics (controlled, structured vocabularies and web ontologies serve as our semantic resource)
Appraoch 2: Distributional semantics (ChatGPT)
